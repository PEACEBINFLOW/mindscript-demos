# mindscript-demos  
### Real-World Demos for the MindScript Ecosystem  
by **Peace Thabiwa — SAGEWORKS AI**

## What is this?

`mindscript-demos` is the **showroom** for MindScript.

Here you’ll find:
- simple CLI flows
- multi-stage reasoning examples
- ledger + runtime loops
- search and recall demos
- integration examples for OpenAI, Gemini, and local models

If `mindscript-core`, `mindscript-templates`, `mindscript-ledger`,
`mindscript-runtime`, and `mindscript-search` are the **engine**,  
this repo is the **test track**.

## Repo Layout

- `2-getting-started/` — how to set up the stack
- `3-cli-flows/` — CLI-based demos
- `4-notebooks/` — notebook-style walkthroughs (Kaggle/Jupyter style)
- `5-integrations/` — flows with specific providers
- `6-product-hunt/` — assets and narratives used in launch
- `7-assets/` — diagrams, screenshot plans, Sora prompt snippets
- `8-roadmap.md` — future demo ideas

---

## Prerequisites

You’ll typically need:
- `mindscript-runtime`
- `mindscript-ledger`
- `mindscript-search`
- Python 3.10+
- API keys if you’re using OpenAI / Gemini demos

## How to Use These Demos

1. Pick a flow in `3-cli-flows/`.
