mindscript-demos is the showcase repository for the MindScript ecosystem.

It contains:
- CLI demos using mindscript-runtime
- end-to-end flows that write to mindscript-ledger
- search examples powered by mindscript-search
- integration demos with OpenAI, Gemini, and local models

This is where people see MindScript in action, not just in theory.
